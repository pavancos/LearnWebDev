                Chennai is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of
                Bengal, it
                is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India. According to the 2011 Indian
                census, it is
                the sixth-most populous city and fourth-most populous urban agglomeration in India. The city together with
                the
                adjoining regions constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area, which is the 36th-largest urban area by
                population in
                the world.

                The traditional and de facto gateway of South India, Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities by
                foreign
                tourists. It was ranked the 43rd-most visited city in the world for the year 2015. The Quality of Living
                Survey rated
                Chennai as the safest city in India. Chennai attracts 45 percent of health tourists visiting India, and
                30 to 40
                percent of domestic health tourists. As such, it is termed "India's health capital". As a growing
                metropolitan city
                in a developing country, Chennai confronts substantial pollution and other logistical and socio-economic
                problems.
