            <p>Hyderabad is the capital of the Indian state of Telangana and de jure capital of Andhra Pradesh. It occupies 650
                square kilometres (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of South
                India. With an average altitude of 542 metres (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around
                artificial lakes, including Hussain Sagar—predating the city's founding—north of the city centre.

                Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad remained under the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for
                nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty
                and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during
                the British Raj, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the
                capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra
                Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 2014, the city has served as the de jure capital of both
                Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
