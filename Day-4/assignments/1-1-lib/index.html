                    But what about the roads?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's demand there will be supply, wee'll all have our roads.

                    Is taxation theft?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If I came to your home with some heavily armed budddies, demanding that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of you income, in return for some crappy monopolised services that you did'nt ask for, would you consider that theft?

                <p>
                    Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
